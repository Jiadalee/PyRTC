# PyRTC: an easy-to-implement approach for benchmarking smart stormwater Real-Time Control simulation by Python
Codes to implement hands-one system-level RTC algorithms based on the [PySWMM](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.02292.pdf_) simulation and [pystorms](https://www.pystorms.org/docs/build/html/index.html) benchmarking gamma model
